# A*
This is a GUI representation of A* search algorithm to demonstrate the working of A*. This representation might be necessary for students who want to understand A* path finding .
It is a great way to demonstrate how computer inputs and resolve a problem.

Red color:
    Red color represents the area that is already explored and not chosen as the path.
Green color:
    Green color represents the area that was to be explored until the final state was found. 
Grey color:
